  Neo3-EventListener - A declarative Signing Spec.
  <br/> Made with ‚ù§ by <b>COZ.IO</b>
</p>

# Neo3-EventListener
Neo3-EventListener is a specification of how clients can interact with different event-listener libraries such as Neon-JS.
Taking advantage of the declarative nature of the specification, the same code can be used with different event-listener libraries.

Visit the [main page](../../README.md) of the project.
